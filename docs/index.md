# What’s is Brando?

**Brando<sup>®</sup>** is the core machine-readable brand identity framework designed to make brands interoperable, enforceable, and discoverable in AI systems and LLM environments. It extends the foundational [`schema:Brand`](https://schema.org/Brand) by modularising key facets of brand identity into six core classes:

* **Verbal Identity** — Tone, voice, style, approved vocabulary, and conversational behaviours
* **Visual Identity** — Logos, colour palettes, typography, iconography, and motion design
* **Audio Identity** — Sonic logos, voice profiles, speech style, and audio cues
* **Positioning** — Mission, vision, core values, audience personas, narrative, and market context
* **Governance** — Brand guardrails, refusal strategies, compliance tags, risk scenarios, and update policies
* **Digital Assets** — Reusable brand resources such as logos, fonts, videos, templates, and AI model configurations

### Extensions and Customisations

While the core classes provide a comprehensive structure, Brando is designed to be extensible. Brands can add:

* **Persona Cards** for AI character scaffolding
* **AI Agent Configurations** for single and multi-agent orchestration
* **Semantic Q&A Assets** for AI grounding and user assistance
* **Compliance Policies** mapped to specific jurisdictions or regulations
* **Product and Service Schemas** aligned with brand offerings

# How does Brando enable interoperability?

Brando uses **JSON-LD** and semantic web standards to uniquely identify each concept with IRIs (Internationalised Resource Identifiers). This ensures that brand metadata is **consistent, machine-readable, and easily exchangeable** across platforms and AI models.

For example, the identifier `https://brandoschema.com/bdv-terms/#toneOfVoice` always refers to the concept of brand tone, regardless of internal naming conventions. Organisations can **align their own terminology** to Brando IRIs to ensure semantic consistency and interoperability.

This interoperability means:

* Brands, AI developers, and compliance teams can share structured brand data confidently
* Different systems can correctly interpret and enforce brand identity rules in AI-generated content
* LLMs can fetch and use authoritative brand instructions, reducing risks of hallucination or misrepresentation

Even organisations without semantic-web expertise can adopt Brando by embedding concept IRIs in databases, spreadsheets, or content management systems to tag and manage brand data with standard semantics.

# What can I do with Brando?

Brando empowers organisations to:

* **Encode brand voice, style, and vocabulary** to control AI language outputs
* **Standardise visual and audio assets** for use in generative media and virtual assistants
* **Articulate brand mission, values, and audience personas** for context-aware AI responses
* **Embed governance policies** to enforce brand safety, compliance, and refusal rules in AI interactions
* **Manage and distribute brand assets** as reusable, retrievable digital resources
* **Integrate AI agent configurations** for consistent behaviour of single and multi-agent AI systems
* **Generate machine-readable documentation** for audits, training, and alignment with regulations

Brando Classes serve as a foundation for building **trustworthy, compliant, and consistent AI-driven brand experiences** across agentic processes, chatbots, voice assistants, content generation, and beyond.

# How does Brando handle jurisdictions and laws?

Brando is designed to be **jurisdiction-agnostic** — its concepts are universal and do not assume any specific legal framework. However, it provides mechanisms to indicate:

* **Applicable jurisdictions** (e.g., US, EU, UK)
* **Relevant regulations and compliance tags** (e.g., GDPR, EU AI Act, UK MHRA)
* **Governance extensions** customized per legal context

By using **extensions and metadata properties**, Brando allows brands to specify which laws govern their identity and how compliance is maintained, without overlapping or mixing regulations.

This flexibility supports multi-jurisdictional brands and ensures AI systems can operate compliantly across borders.
