# About Advanced Analytica

**Advanced Analytica** is the company behind the **Brando (Brand Oracle) schema** and the broader concept of AI-native **Brand Operating Systems**.

We work with organisations that need to go beyond “just another model” and instead:

- connect people, processes, information, and technology,
- structure their brand and domain knowledge,
- and operate AI systems with **governance, traceability, and control**.

Our focus is on turning complex, high-value knowledge (brand, legal, operational) into:

- **machine-readable assets** (schemas, graphs, ontologies),
- **agentic systems** that act on those assets,
- and **governance patterns** that keep everything explainable and auditable.

---

## What we do

We design and build **intelligent systems** and **synthetic datasets** that sit on top of structured vocabularies like Brando.

Typical engagements combine:

- **Knowledge transformation**  
  Extracting and structuring your tacit knowledge, policies, and guidelines into JSON-LD / YAML, knowledge graphs, and Brando-aligned schemas.

- **Agentic AI and intelligent tooling**  
  Building AI agents and microsolutions that:
  - use Brando and other schemas as a control layer,
  - integrate with your existing stack (DAM, CMS, CRM, portals),
  - and support human decision-makers instead of replacing them.

- **Runtime governance and observability**  
  Instrumenting prompts, policies, and outputs so you can:
  - see how brand and risk rules are applied,
  - adjust enforcement levels over time,
  - and prove what your systems were instructed to do.

Our work spans:

- content and communication systems,
- internal copilots and assistants,
- domain-specific reasoning tools (legal, financial, healthcare, risk),
- and AI-first brand and product experiences.

## Our mission

We exist to **make AI work for you on your terms** – not the other way round.

That means:

- giving decision-makers access to **trusted data and expert intent** at the exact moment it matters,
- encoding that intent in **schemas and knowledge graphs** (like Brando),
- and using agentic AI to **amplify**, not replace, the judgement of the teams who know your business best.

Our goal is to turn your data, policies, and brand strategy into **operational, machine-readable assets** that:

- accelerate insight,
- control costs,
- mitigate risk,
- and support confident action.

---

## Our vision

Our vision is a world where:

- brands and organisations publish **living, governed knowledge graphs**,
- AI runtimes and agents treat those graphs as **first-class control planes**,
- and synthetic personas, policies, and tokens make complex systems **predictable, testable, and auditable**.

Brando is one piece of that – the schema for **brand behaviour**.  
Advanced Analytica designs the surrounding **systems and practices** that make it real.

    <h3>Intelligent Systems</h3>
    <p>Design and deploy intelligent systems that orchestrate data, models, and rules—combining human-in-the-loop workflows with AI-driven assistance and automation.</p>
  </div>

  <div style="flex: 1 1 calc(50% - 1rem); border: 1px solid #ddd; border-radius: 8px; padding: 1.5rem; box-shadow: 0 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);">
    <h3>Agentic AI</h3>
    <p>Agent-style AI that can plan, execute, and coordinate tasks using brand and domain schemas as constraints—for design, testing, operations, and communication workflows.</p>
  </div>

  <div style="flex: 1 1 calc(50% - 1rem); border: 1px solid #ddd; border-radius: 8px; padding: 1.5rem; box-shadow: 0 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);">

## How we’re different

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; gap: 1rem;">

  <div style="flex: 1 1 calc(50% - 1rem); border: 1px solid #ddd; border-radius: 8px; padding: 1.5rem; box-shadow: 0 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);">
    <h3>Schema-first, not model-first</h3>
    <p>We start from semantics, governance, and data structures (like Brando), then choose or compose models around that. This keeps systems explainable and adaptable as model options change.</p>
  </div>

  <div style="flex: 1 1 calc(50% - 1rem); border: 1px solid #ddd; border-radius: 8px; padding: 1.5rem; box-shadow: 0 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);">
    <h3>Decades of applied experience</h3>
    <p>We draw on decades of work across data management, AI, knowledge engineering, and governance—especially in regulated and complex environments where “just ship a model” isn’t enough.</p>
  </div>

  <div style="flex: 1 1 calc(50% - 1rem); border: 1px solid #ddd; border-radius: 8px; padding: 1.5rem; box-shadow: 0 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);">
    <h3>Governance as a feature</h3>
    <p>We treat risk, compliance, and auditability as design inputs, not afterthoughts—encoding them into schemas, policies, and automation rules from day one.</p>
  </div>

  <div style="flex: 1 1 calc(50% - 1rem); border: 1px solid #ddd; border-radius: 8px; padding: 1.5rem; box-shadow: 0 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);">
    <h3>Scalable, modular patterns</h3>
    <p>We prefer patterns and building blocks (schemas, tokens, policies, automations) over one-off solutions, so you can grow from pilot to platform without starting again.</p>
  </div>
