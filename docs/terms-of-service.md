# Terms of Service

_Last updated: 22/11/2025_

These Terms of Service (“**Terms**”) govern your access to and use of:

- the website available at **https://brandoschema.com** and any subdomains (the “**Site**”), and  
- the documentation, examples, and related materials for the **Brando (Brand Oracle) schema** made available on or via the Site (collectively, the “**Services**”).

The Services are operated by **Advanced Analytica Ltd** (“**Advanced Analytica**”, “**we**”, “**us**”, or “**our**”).

By accessing, browsing, or using the Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms.  
If you do not agree with these Terms, you must not use the Services.

> **Important**  
> These Terms are provided for informational and operational purposes and do **not** constitute legal advice to you. You should obtain your own legal review before relying on or reusing this text for your own organisation.

## 1. Scope of the Services

1.1 **Documentation and schema.**  
The primary purpose of the Site is to provide:

- documentation for the **Brando (Brand Oracle) schema and vocabulary**,  
- examples of how to model Brand Knowledge Graphs and Brand Operating Systems, and  
- related explanatory materials.

1.2 **Informational and technical, not commercial SaaS.**  
The Services are **documentation and reference** only. The Site is **not** a hosted software-as-a-service platform. Any software, libraries, or examples referenced:

- are provided as technical illustrations, and  
- may be distributed through other channels (e.g. GitHub) under separate licenses.

1.3 **No guarantee of availability.**  
We may modify, suspend, or discontinue any part of the Services at any time, with or without notice. We are under no obligation to maintain any particular content, example, or API compatibility.

---

## 2. Eligibility and acceptable use

2.1 **Eligibility.**  
You may use the Services only if you:

- are at least 18 years old (or the age of majority in your jurisdiction), and  
- have the legal capacity to enter into these Terms.

If you are using the Services on behalf of an organisation, you represent that you have authority to bind that organisation, and “you” in these Terms will refer to both you individually and that organisation.

2.2 **Acceptable use.**  
You agree not to:

- use the Services for any unlawful, fraudulent, or malicious activity;
- attempt to gain unauthorised access to, interfere with, or disrupt the Site or its infrastructure;
- use any automated means (bots, scrapers, crawlers) to access the Site in a manner that:
  - imposes an unreasonable load, or
  - attempts to circumvent technical or rate-limiting measures;
- misrepresent your affiliation with Advanced Analytica or claim that your products or services are officially endorsed or certified by us without written permission;
- remove, obscure, or alter any copyright, trademark, or other proprietary notices on the Site or within the documentation.

We reserve the right to restrict or block access to the Site where we reasonably believe these Terms have been or may be breached.

## 3. Intellectual property

### 3.1 Ownership of the Site and content

Unless otherwise indicated:

- the Site, its layout, and all text, graphics, diagrams, and other content on the Site (collectively, the “**Content**”) are owned by or licensed to **Advanced Analytica Ltd**, and  
- are protected by copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property laws.

Except as explicitly permitted in these Terms or by an applicable open-source or content license, you may not copy, modify, distribute, or create derivative works of the Content.

### 3.2 Brando schema and vocabulary

The **Brando Brand Definition Vocabulary (BDV)** and associated schema/vocabulary definitions (including the JSON-LD terms described on this Site):

- are developed and maintained by Advanced Analytica, and  
- are intended as a **vendor-neutral, open schema**.

Use of the Brando schema in your own software, documentation, or data structures is governed by:

- the **open-source license** specified in the relevant `LICENSE` file in the official Brando repository (e.g. on GitHub: `https://github.com/JonathanBowker/brandoschema`), and  
- any additional license notices included with example code or artefacts.

Where there is a conflict between these Terms and the explicit terms of an open-source license applied to specific code or schema artefacts, the **open-source license terms** will govern your use of that code/schema.

### 3.3 Examples and sample code

Code snippets, configuration examples, and JSON-LD/YAML fragments (“**Examples**”) published on the Site are provided to help you:

- understand how to use the Brando schema, and  
- prototype your own Brand Knowledge Graphs and integrations.

Unless otherwise stated:

- you may copy, adapt, and reuse Examples in your own projects,  
- provided that you:
  - do not remove references to the `brando:` namespace where they are semantically required, and
  - do not misrepresent the Examples as your own original specification of the Brando schema.

Where feasible, we recommend including attribution such as:

> “Based on examples from the Brando (Brand Oracle) schema documentation at brandoschema.com, © Advanced Analytica Ltd.”

### 3.4 Brando name and trademarks

“**Brando**”, “**Brand Oracle**”, “**Brand Oracle (Brando)**” and associated logos are trademarks or registered trademarks of **Advanced Analytica Ltd**.

You may refer to Brando in descriptive, factual ways (e.g. “This tool is compatible with the Brando schema v1.3”) subject to the guidelines in [Using the Brando name and trademark](use-brando-trademark.md).

You must not:

- use the Brando or Brand Oracle names in a way that suggests your product or service is officially produced, endorsed, or certified by Advanced Analytica without explicit written permission;
- use the Brando logo or trade dress as part of your own logo or brand identity.

---

## 4. User content and submissions

4.1 **Feedback and suggestions.**  
If you provide feedback, suggestions, or ideas (“**Feedback**”) about the Brando schema, documentation, or the Site:

- you do so voluntarily, and  
- you agree that Advanced Analytica is free to use, modify, and incorporate such Feedback without obligation to you.

We may use Feedback to:

- improve the schema and documentation,  
- update examples and best-practice guides,  
- or shape future versions and profiles.

4.2 **Form submissions and contact.**  
If you submit information through forms (e.g. “Talk to us” contact forms, Typeform embeds, or similar):

- you are responsible for ensuring that the information is accurate and you have the right to share it;
- we will use that information in accordance with our **Privacy Policy** (if published separately) or as reasonably necessary to respond to your enquiry and operate our business.

You must not submit confidential, proprietary, or sensitive information to us **unless** we have explicitly agreed to receive it under a separate written agreement (such as an NDA or services contract).

---

## 5. No professional, legal, or regulatory advice

The Services and Content:

- are provided for **general informational and technical purposes only**, and  
- do **not** constitute legal, regulatory, financial, or professional advice.

You are solely responsible for:

- evaluating the suitability of the Brando schema and any examples for your particular use case,
- ensuring that your implementation complies with applicable laws, regulations, and industry standards (e.g. data protection, consumer protection, financial or health-sector regulations),
- obtaining appropriate professional advice where required.

Advanced Analytica does **not** accept any responsibility for decisions you make based on the Content, Examples, or any high-level guidance on this Site.

---

## 6. No warranties

To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Services and Content are provided:

> **“AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE”, without any warranty of any kind.**

Without limiting the foregoing, we do not warrant that:

- the Site or Content will be **accurate, complete, or up to date**;
- the Site will be **uninterrupted, secure, or free from errors**;
- any schemas, examples, or integrations will be **fit for a particular purpose**, suitable for production use, or free from defects or vulnerabilities;
- the Site or any content on it will always be available at any given time.

Any use of the Brando schema, Examples, or guidance is **at your own risk**.

---

## 7. Limitation of liability

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event will Advanced Analytica Ltd, its directors, officers, employees, or contractors be liable for:

- any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages;  
- any loss of profits, revenue, data, goodwill, or business opportunities;  
- or any loss or damage whatsoever arising out of or in connection with:

  - your use of or inability to use the Services;  
  - your reliance on any Content, Examples, or guidance provided on the Site;  
  - or any unauthorised access to or use of our servers or systems.

Our total aggregate liability arising out of or relating to the Services or these Terms is limited to **GBP £100** (one hundred pounds sterling) or the minimum liability that cannot be excluded under applicable law, whichever is higher.

Nothing in these Terms excludes or limits liability:

- for death or personal injury caused by negligence,  
- for fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation,  
- or for any other matter that cannot be excluded under applicable law.

---

## 8. Third-party links and services

The Site may contain:

- links to third-party websites or services, and  
- embedded content or scripts from third parties (for example, analytics providers, Typeform, or other tools).

These third-party sites and services are not under our control. We are not responsible for:

- the content or practices of any third-party sites,  
- any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with your use of or reliance on any such content, goods, or services.

Your use of third-party services is subject to their own terms and policies, not ours.

---

## 9. Privacy and data protection

We may collect and process limited personal information:

- when you access the Site (e.g. analytics data), and  
- when you contact us or submit forms.

Any such processing is carried out:

- for the purposes of operating and improving the Services, and  
- in accordance with applicable data protection laws.

If we publish a separate **Privacy Policy** on the Site, its terms will govern how we collect, use, and protect your personal data. In case of conflict between these Terms and a published Privacy Policy in relation to personal data, the Privacy Policy will apply.

---

## 10. Changes to these Terms

We may update these Terms from time to time, for example:

- to reflect changes in the Brando schema or documentation,  
- to account for new features or services,  
- or to comply with legal or regulatory requirements.

When we make material changes, we will:

- update the “Last updated” date at the top of this page, and  
- may, at our discretion, provide additional notice (e.g. a banner on the Site).

By continuing to use the Services after changes take effect, you agree to the revised Terms.  
If you do not agree to the updated Terms, you must stop using the Services.

---

## 11. Termination and suspension

We may, at our sole discretion, suspend or restrict your access to the Site or Services if we reasonably believe that:

- you have breached these Terms, or  
- your use of the Services poses a risk to the security, availability, or integrity of the Site or other users.

Because the Site is primarily public documentation with no user accounts, such actions will typically take the form of **technical access controls** (e.g. IP blocking) rather than account termination.

You may cease using the Services at any time.  
Sections that by their nature should survive termination (including Intellectual Property, No Warranties, Limitation of Liability, and Governing Law) will continue to apply.

---

## 12. Governing law and jurisdiction

These Terms and any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with them or the Services (including non-contractual disputes or claims) will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of **England and Wales**, without regard to its conflict of law rules.

You and Advanced Analytica agree that the courts of **England and Wales** will have **exclusive jurisdiction** to settle any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with these Terms or the Services.

> _If Advanced Analytica is incorporated in a different jurisdiction, you may wish to update this section to match your actual place of incorporation and preferred dispute forum._

---

## 13. Miscellaneous

- **Entire agreement.**  
  These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and Advanced Analytica regarding your use of the Services and supersede any prior agreements or understandings relating to the same subject matter.

- **Severability.**  
  If any provision of these Terms is found to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect.

- **No waiver.**  
  Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those rights.

- **Assignment.**  
  You may not assign or transfer any of your rights or obligations under these Terms without our prior written consent. We may assign our rights and obligations under these Terms in connection with a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, or by operation of law.
